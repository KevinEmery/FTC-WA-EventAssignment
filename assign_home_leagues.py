# 7/28/24 Notes
# At present the Zip Code Assignment appears to produce better results when combined with
# some fiddling on pre-assignments. Some of the standalone 1-2 team zip codes end up mis-assigned
# and need to be manually placed, but the algorithm runs fast enough that doing that is trivial.
# The added bonus is that teams in the same school/zip are automatically kept together
#
# Per-team assignment could yield better results given enough iterations (although the 10-100
# iterations I have done locally score worse), but risks breaking up related teams without adding
# further logic to be able to tie teams together (other than pre-assigning all of them). I'm leaving
# the code here for posterity but expect that we'll move forward with zip-code assignment for now.
